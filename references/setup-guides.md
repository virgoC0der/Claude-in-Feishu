## Telegram

### Bot Token

**How to get a Telegram Bot Token:**
1. Open Telegram and search for `@BotFather`
2. Send `/newbot` to create a new bot
3. Follow the prompts: choose a display name and a username (must end in `bot`)
4. BotFather will reply with a token like `7823456789:AAF-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`
5. Copy the full token and paste it here

**Recommended bot settings** (send these commands to @BotFather):
- `/setprivacy` → choose your bot → `Disable` (so the bot can read group messages, only needed for group use)
- `/setcommands` → set commands like `new - Start new session`, `mode - Switch mode`

Token format: `数字:字母数字字符串` (e.g. `7823456789:AAF-xxx...xxx`)

### Allowed User IDs (optional)

**How to find your Telegram User ID:**
1. Search for `@userinfobot` on Telegram and start a chat
2. It will reply with your User ID (a number like `123456789`)
3. Alternatively, forward a message from yourself to `@userinfobot`

Enter comma-separated IDs to restrict access (recommended for security).
Leave empty to allow anyone who can message the bot.

## Feishu / Lark

### App ID and App Secret

**How to create a Feishu/Lark app and get credentials:**
1. Go to Feishu: https://open.feishu.cn/app or Lark: https://open.larksuite.com/app
2. Click **"Create Custom App"**
3. Fill in the app name and description → click **"Create"**
4. On the app's **"Credentials & Basic Info"** page, find:
   - **App ID** (like `cli_xxxxxxxxxx`)
   - **App Secret** (click to reveal, like `xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`)

### Step A — Batch-add required permissions

1. On the app page, go to **"Permissions & Scopes"**
2. Instead of adding permissions one by one, use **batch configuration**: click the **"Batch switch to configure by dependency"** link (or find the JSON editor)
3. Paste the following JSON to add all required permissions at once:

```json
{
  "scopes": {
    "tenant": [
      "aily:file:read",
      "aily:file:write",
      "application:application.app_message_stats.overview:readonly",
      "application:application:self_manage",
      "application:bot.menu:write",
      "contact:user.employee_id:readonly",
      "corehr:file:download",
      "event:ip_list",
      "im:chat.access_event.bot_p2p_chat:read",
      "im:chat.members:bot_access",
      "im:message",
      "im:message.group_at_msg:readonly",
      "im:message.p2p_msg:readonly",
      "im:message:readonly",
      "im:message:send_as_bot",
      "im:resource",
      "drive:drive",
      "drive:drive:readonly",
      "docx:document",
      "docx:document:readonly",
      "sheets:spreadsheet",
      "bitable:app",
      "calendar:calendar",
      "calendar:calendar:readonly",
      "search:docs"
    ],
    "user": [
      "aily:file:read",
      "aily:file:write",
      "im:chat.access_event.bot_p2p_chat:read",
      "drive:drive",
      "drive:drive:readonly",
      "docx:document",
      "docx:document:readonly",
      "sheets:spreadsheet",
      "bitable:app",
      "calendar:calendar",
      "calendar:calendar:readonly"
    ]
  }
}
```

4. Click **"Save"** to apply all permissions

### Step B — Enable the bot

1. Go to **"Add Features"** → enable **"Bot"**
2. Set the bot name and description

### Step C — Configure Events & Callbacks (long connection)

1. Go to **"Events & Callbacks"** in the left sidebar
2. Under **"Event Dispatch Method"**, select **"Long Connection"** (长连接 / WebSocket mode)
3. Click **"Add Event"** and add these events:
   - `im.message.receive_v1` — Receive messages
   - `p2p_chat_create` — Bot added to chat (optional but recommended)
4. Click **"Save"**

### Step D — Publish the app

1. Go to **"Version Management & Release"** → click **"Create Version"**
2. Fill in version number and update description → click **"Save"**
3. Click **"Submit for Review"**
4. For personal/test use, the admin can approve it directly in the **Feishu Admin Console** → **App Review**
5. **Important:** The bot will NOT respond to messages until the version is approved and published

### Step E — OAuth Authorization (for user-space docs/calendar)

**Why is this needed?**
By default, the bot uses a `tenant_access_token` (bot token). Documents and calendar events created with this token live in the **bot's space** — the user cannot see them in their Feishu app.

To make Claude-created documents appear in the **user's own Drive**, you need a `user_access_token` via OAuth:

1. Run the OAuth authorization script:
   ```bash
   FEISHU_APP_ID=your_app_id FEISHU_APP_SECRET=your_app_secret python3 scripts/feishu_oauth.py
   ```
2. A browser window will open asking you to authorize the app
3. After authorization, the token is saved to `~/.claude-in-feishu/feishu_user_token.json`
4. The token auto-refreshes; if it expires completely, re-run the script

**For calendar visibility:**
Even with a user token, bot-created events may land on the bot's default calendar. The recommended approach:
1. Create a **shared calendar** in Feishu (e.g., "Claude Tasks")
2. Find its `calendar_id` via `python3 scripts/feishu_docs.py cal_list`
3. Configure the bot to create events on that shared calendar

### Domain (optional)

Default: `https://open.feishu.cn`
Use `https://open.larksuite.com` for Lark (international version).
Leave empty to use the default Feishu domain.

### Allowed User IDs (optional)

Feishu user IDs (open_id format like `ou_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`).
You can find them in the Feishu Admin Console under user profiles.
Leave empty to allow all users who can message the bot.
